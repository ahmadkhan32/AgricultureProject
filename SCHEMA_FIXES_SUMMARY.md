# âœ… Database Schema Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Services RLS Policy** âœ…
**Problem:** 
- Policy only allowed viewing services with `status = 'active'`
- But default status is `'published'`
- Result: Published services were not viewable

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Before (WRONG):
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view active services" ON services
    FOR SELECT USING (status = 'active');

-- After (FIXED):
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view published or active services" ON services
    FOR SELECT USING (status IN ('published', 'active'));
```

**Impact:** 
- âœ… Published services are now viewable by all users
- âœ… Active services remain viewable
- âœ… Matches the default status setting

---

2. **Verify policies:**
